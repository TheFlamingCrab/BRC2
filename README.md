# BRC2

### Introduction

Bard code 2 (BRC2) is a symmetric encryption system, using a user chosen string of bytes as a key.

### Functionality

BRC2 was designed with security in mind. Both the length of the text and the contents of the text is hidden from anyone who does not have the key.

### Usage

When using BRC2, it is important to ensure that you provide a full path, instead of providing the path to a directory.
